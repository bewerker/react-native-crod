## Application Description
The mobile application of Crowdocracy is a solution for any organization that wants to include its staff into decision making and wants to know their opinions. Ever more organizations want to give their workers a part in making decisions about internal plans. However, the larger an organization is, the more difficult it is to ask everyone what they think. This app provides a central platform where users can vote on topics and proposals. The app contains categories of statements, so that users can turn on or off what kind of topics are shown to them. After the voting, user-friendly statistical data and graphics are produced to give an easily understandable overview of the results.
	Besides proposals and voting, the app provides the possibility to argue on the concerning topics and offer modifications on existing proposals.
